 ðŸ“Œ Overview

The increasing deployment of resource-constrained IoT devices introduces new security challenges. Traditional fingerprinting methods relying on payloads are often inefficient or less accurate. This project addresses this by:

- Extracting packet headers o from network flows.
- Using Nilsimsa, a locality-sensitive hashing algorithm, to generate device-specific fingerprints.
- Performing similarity-based classification to identify IoT devices with high precision and minimal overhead.
